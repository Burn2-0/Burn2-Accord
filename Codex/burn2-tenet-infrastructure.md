# Our Tenet for Infrastructure Continuity

We will build a sustainable organization with assets and infrastructure that we can pass on to future leaders.

None of us will be here forever. We do this by gifting the infrastructure content and license to use it to Burn2. Items placed with the avatar M2 Burner or in BURN2 commonly held folders on Google Docs or in other commonly held locations are our gifts with the Creative Commons license.
