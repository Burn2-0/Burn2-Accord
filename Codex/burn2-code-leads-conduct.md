# Code of Conduct for Leadership

“Let your actions respect the spirit of a gift; don't be jealous or possessive of power, don't withhold information, don't blame other people, don't refuse to give credit, and don't ignore the abilities of others — if you don't, you are probably abusing your authority.” (From an article by Larry Harvey, reworded)

* Leads should first and foremost follow the 10 Principles and the Burn2 Code of Ethics.
* Leads also observe the 11th Principle, Consent respecting “no” or a request to “stop”.
* Leads are subject to the same Rights and Responsibilities of Volunteers as all other volunteers, which are listed on this page below and in a notecard that is distributed to volunteers in Burn2.
* Leads utilize consensus as their decision making process at meetings.
* Leads will refrain from non consensual, demeaning, discriminating or harassing behavior, or making accusatory statements in any public forum against others. Use group chat, discord and other forms of communication respectfully. We do not share rumors or present opinions as fact. If an opinion cannot be backed up with facts, use words like “in my opinion”.
* Leads will engage in professional qualities of honesty, flexibility and confidentiality. They use respectful language despite any differences of opinion, recognize when they are triggered, and know when to stop and cool off.
* Leads do not share the contents of meetings except for agreed upon release of information to the community.
* Leads value each other's opinions and try to resolve problems together. They do not undermine or go behind/around another lead or engage in defamation of another lead. They do not interrupt or hijack meetings to promote a personal agenda.
* Leads should endeavor to seek the wisdom and consent of other leads for any major policy change or proposal in their department that may affect other departments.
* Leads do not abuse their positions - or misuse the authority they have while in service to the community.
* Leads act in the best interest of the Burn2 community they represent. Each Lead is responsible for sharing relevant content from the meetings to their department - and vice versa.
