# Child Avatar Policy

## Burn2 Policy on Child Avatars and Nudity

### Background

Burn2 is an extension of the Burning Man culture into SL, and we try to mirror many aspects of Burning Man in-world. Clothing optional (non-sexual adult nudity) is a long-accepted part of Burner culture in real life and at Burn2. In addition, the presence of children was allowed at Burning Man and child avatars at Burn2 for some years, each with similar restrictions.

In May 2024, Linden LabÂ® changed their Child Avatar Policy which impacted many regions in SL, including Burn2. Specifically:

"A child Avatar is not permitted to be at any event or location, where nudity or sexual activities are either present, encouraged, or expected."

As the new policy was announced in advance, Burn2 had to decide whether to allow adult nudity, or to allow child avatars. A team at Burn2 conducted a community poll on their preferences and did research on our options, and the results were published. The majority of participants did not want to exclude either but understood a choice needed to be made. The leads team were then tasked to complete the new Burn2 Child Avatar Policy to be consistent with the community preferences from the poll and considering all options and research points.

In short, there was a 5-to-1 (81%) vote in favor of nudity over child avatars, with 118 verified responses. We felt this is a sufficient margin for decision-making, so we have formed our child avatar policy to reflect these results.

Regrettably, we can no longer allow child avatars at Burn2. This is not a decision we wanted to make, but feel it is in accordance with the wishes expressed in the community poll.

### The Policy

From Linden Lab's Child Avatar Policy: "A child Avatar is not permitted to be at any event or location, where nudity or sexual activities are either present, encouraged, or expected."

Non-sexual adult nudity is allowed and expected at Burn2.

Therefore, child avatars are not allowed at Burn2.

### Child Avatar Defined

A child avatar looks younger than 18 years of age, or through their conduct or words they express or imply they are under 18.
