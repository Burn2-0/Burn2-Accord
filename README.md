* [Draft: Burn2 By-laws (Talia Variant)](/Draft/By-Laws-Talia/index.md)
After the conclusion (apparently) of the RIST Report. It was mentioned in that meeting that the only way that things were to change at Burn2 was through the applciation of By-Laws. Now Talia had tried exhibit an interest in being apart of that and much like the RIST team it had been a somewhat secretive group that operated out of sight without transparency.
The way in which she was told that the by-laws were the only way to effect change at Burn-2 was not exactly optimum. The leader of said exclusionary group, That she'd asked to be a part of, The group that Talia had assumed for months had died a quiet death, took her by surprise revealing it's continued existance and had decided to do a virtual mic drop to suffix his statement. 
The worst part was that this group had been so quiet during the entire process that led to the place that things were. Was trying for a "holier than thou" position in all of it. 
So these documents. i.e.  "Talia's By-Laws" were initially started from a position of "Let's see how long a set of by laws could possibly take to write up." It was the fury that this group who held (according to them) the only method to her salvation had litterally sat back and watched what had been happening for the months prior to that point and had done nothing.
That, She'll admit, is not a good foundation to build a new consititution from. But...
  * ...within 40 hrs of the end of the meeting there was a rough draft ready to go.
  * ...during those 40 hrs, Talia wanting to do the best she could, got deep to the root of the issues looking at:
    * The many things she felt wrong with burn2 and working out fair methods to prevent them being even considered in the future.
    * Then more importantly, looking at what truely inspired her about virtual burns, what could be done to promote the "anything is possible" memories of burns she had.
  * ...After realising that what she had written was enough to have prevented all the unjust actions that she'd expereience in the preceeding 6 months, and also was a document pretty much moved her to tears thinking about the potential future it could represented. She paused in her writing to talk to the leader of the official by-laws committee to confess that:
    * ...His comment had been taken and left her feeling the way that she had been. (Not the best opening to "I hope you can take these into consideration..." but it was the truth and as a lot of aspects of her by-laws were focused on there being one transparent truth that included all burners it would have been hypocrtical to have doen anything else).
    * ...That her action in response to that had started as a "I'll show you..." but the nature of what she'd written had turned what her fury into inspired hope for the potential for Burn 2.
    * ...That she got that if any of it was to be used she needed to try be on good terms with the By-Laws Committee, for which she knew the identity of the leader and one other member, and not suddenly out of no where show up with a completed set of unilateral by-laws that had been completed as an example of how quick a single motivated person could get through a task compared to the secretive commitee that can been so secretive she'd assumed their death. 
  * Last time the lead of that committee has acknowledged any communication from Talia (at the time of writing) was when she tried to notify him of the data breech in which 335 people had their emails and Inworld names insecurely stored on the burn2.org site. When asked if he wanted to know about it the reply was along the lines of one of the three monkeys (hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil). That was end of september... Prior to that had been April, and at at the RIST meeting, that incited this document.

* [Draft: Standards - The missing documents](/Standards/)
As was mentioned in the previous section, Burn2 exererienced a Data Breach. The issue was that all the forms that Volunteers and Performers used to sign up for Burn2 fed their results into the WP-Content directory on the Burn2.org website. Normally that folder woudl be protected from this through obsfucation. i.e. it should be impossible to find out the contents of the directory unless you were to get through each possible file name there could possibly be try to open each one. However that direct was not secured properly which meant that anyone could open the folder and it would provide them with a listing of all the file names. With that list you were able to open any of the files in the directory.
Talia having had experience of dealing with GDPR not only knew she HAD to report the fact it had been found. She also knew that even though banned she was the best person to try help fix the issue.
So after the initial reporting of the breach. She sat down at compiled the documents you find in this folder. These documents and the policies they represent would bring Burn2 up to scratch with regards to GDPR. 
She completed them within the 72hrs deadline for even making the announcement about the breach. It was required that within the 72 hours after hearing of the breach that certain things were to happen. 
Firstly informing the appropirate agencies that the databreach had occured. Had anyone from North Europe been involved with the breach then that would have meant that for Brits that was the ICO and then for any other Europeans the ICO's equivalent.
Second the breech itself needed to be fixed on the entire platform needed to be shutdown. What occured was at best a partial fix. 
Third those involved should be notified. Whilst this is not a requirement for the level of data left out in the open, it was considered to be best practise as it woudl exhibit accountability and show a willingingness to look bad for the protection of the people involved and obviously that would lead to amore definitive fix in the long run.

What actually resulted:
* within dealine (just) a partial fix was applied, 
* after the deadline the ICO was told but not by anyone official with Burn2. 
* Then a full week after the initial report a group notice was posted about the breech. 
   (again partial minimal attempt to inform. The use of the group notice meant that only 17% of the people affect would be able to see the notice.. and yes you saw that right. The breech which involved every performer and volunteer who had signed up via the website form. At the end of those 4 years when the group had a notification sent out only 17% of the signups still remained in the group.)
