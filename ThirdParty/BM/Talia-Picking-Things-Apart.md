# Talia Picking Things Apart

## BRC Regional Agreement

* "If you would like to host an Official Burning Man Regional Event, you will need to first enter into a Regional Event Use Agreement with Burning Man, which helps ensure that your event complies with the criteria below, Burning Man’s Ten Principles, and other guidelines..." *How many guidelines and more importantly principles have I so far notified you about?*
* "The event should aim to involve and benefit the entire community, rather than just one or two theme camps/entities..." *39% traffic drop 23 to 24, 83% of volunteers/performers over a 4 year period didn't receive a notice sent to the groups. Multiple bans argued.*
* "the event should be open to all, and everyone should be welcome to participate in creating the event and expressing themselves at it—provided such participation is not in conflict with the Ten Principles,"
* "The event should seek to provide a forum for artistic expression of the widest range possible.  Not simply music,... " *At Burning Life there was an entire art dept that worked hand in hand with DPW. Art Dept was the Form, DPW was Function. Burn2, "Art Dept" got rolled into "Placement", is currently unstaffed and so the placement leads begrudgingly try find some artist to chuck some stuff down. It also looks like Performance Dept is headed the same way. Since Puddles' Ban they have failed to find anyone willing to step into the role.*
* "The event—including its planning, organizing, marketing, promotion, and operation— must adhere to the Ten Principles of Burning Man.  " *Again Radical Inclusion... Participation... Radical Self-Expression.. I tend to make the bitter sweet joke that there is at least one principle they like to try to stick with... Leave No Trace... But I don't think that was ever intended to be people.*
* "The producer of the event must obtain and comply with all necessary permits and licenses (e.g., occupancy, fire, sound, etc.) and comply with all applicable laws and regulations in producing the event.  " *Just take a look at the response to the data-breach.. As they provide the event to residents of the EU and the UK, they fall under the requirements of GDPR. They have seriously failed in following those guidelines.*
* "The producer of the event must obtain appropriate insurance coverage for the event," *I don't know but I doubt they have this.*
* "The producer of the event  must ensure that the event will have appropriate safety, medical, security, a" *Again data breach.*
* "As the producer, you understand that neither Burning Man nor Black Rock City LLC has agreed to or will manage or supervise your event, and that you are responsible for any claim, loss, cost, expense, damage, or other liability arising out of or in connection with the event. Neither Burning Man nor Black Rock City LLC accepts any liability in connection with the event." *Well this might explain your silence.* ***shrugs***
* "If charging for admission to the event, all accounting related to the event must be transparent (i.e., the financials related to the event must be reported to the community, with results either being tracked in real time online or posted publicly within 30 days of the conclusion of the event or by the end of the producer’s financial accounting period)" *The only time I've see such data is when iSkye posted the spreadsheet listing all the financials for 23 during a meeting and when I say, "the financials" it was literally the records of plot sales including all the personal data of the people that paid for the plots. So I don't think this was the intended transparency. This data has not been released for '24 yet.*

## RC Contract

* "When answering questions about Burning Man." *334 words since my ban.*
* "Read Burning Man Project’s Annual Report to understand the organization’s activities and the Burning Man AfterBurn Report to understand the event’s production," *Pretty sure the above shows there is either a lack of reading or understanding about the requirements of event production.*
* "An RC is often the first point of contact for local participants," *Pretty sure they are not supposed to be the last.*
* "Help facilitate collaboration in your community: RCs are encouraged to build and nurture Burning Man communities in their local areas. This often happens organically as people interact, create, and socialize around projects and events...an RC should encourage those who are willing to volunteer their time on community efforts.." *Signing off on bans?*
* "An RC should seek to cultivate this “next generation” of leaders." *83% loss of volunteers over 4 years.*
* "To apply for official status for any event, the event’s producer must first obtain the endorsement of at least one RC in the Region. Upon receipt of an application for an event in your Region, the Regional Network Team will ask for your assessment of whether the producer’s plans comply with the Criteria for Official Regional Events and the Ten Principles of Burning Man, based on your knowledge of the Region and the individuals involved." *Sooo Guess the whole ************** idea is dead before it began even though it should be blatantly obvious I am fastidious about rules and the RC I would needed to sign off last signed off my ban.*
* "C. **Provide conflict support**: An RC may be asked to help **mediate** and **work through conflicts among members** of their local community. In these cases, the RC should maintain a **neutral stance**, **collect as much relevant feedback as possible**, and respect confidentiality when requested. Ideally, the RC will work with the relevant local conduct committees or leadership teams. Should an RC need help in **mediating** or **working through conflicts**, they can escalate to and request the help of the following groups as appropriate: the **Conflict Support Meta Regional Subcommittee**, **Regional Network Team**, Official Events Team, and the Regional Rangers. Please refer to the complaint and feedback procedures on the Burning Man website as a guide. " *So I put in a complaint against two of the leads of the Events team, One of whom is the Lead Ranger. My ban came 4 days later. No One Contacted me during those four days.Then I received my ban signed off by 3v.*
* "D. Adhere to **behavioral standards** and **avoid conflicts of interest**: While serving as an RC, you are expected to comply with **Burning Man’s Behavioral Standards Agreement** and uphold a **high standard of ethics**, including with respect to **conflicts of interest**. A conflict of interest may arise when an RC’s personal interests conflict with their obligation to act in the best interests of Burning Man Project and/or their local community. A conflict of interest may be **actual, potential or perceived**, and may be financial or **non-financial**. As an RC, you are expected to: ● **Avoid conflicts of interest where possible**. ● **Identify and disclose any potential conflicts of interest** " *Soo The fact that I issued 2 complaints against the leads and then I got a ban.... No conflict of interest there? Nothing worth reporting?*

## BRC Harassment Policy

* "**Burning Man will not retaliate against any individual for filing a complaint** or participating in an investigation, and **will not tolerate** or permitretaliation by management or **any other staff member.**" *Like banning someone in the way I was banned? Seemingly to duck out of dealing with the complaint I made?*
