INSERT ROLE, Burning Man Project Regional Contact
Date: Date:

SCHEDULE A:
REGIONAL CONTACT’S RESPONSIBILITIES
The role of a Regional Contact (or “RC”) is to build and support a Burning Man community in a local
area. An interest in attending the Burning Man event in Black Rock City is not a requirement for
someone to be a member of a Region’s community or to be considered a “Burner.” Burning Man Project
considers Burning Man to be a year-round, global community comprised of individuals, groups, and
events.
While much of the Regional Contact’s role is defined by the individual, what follows is a practical
description of the core responsibilities you agree to undertake as a Regional Contact.
1. COMMUNICATION
A. Communicate with Burning Man Project: The connection between each RC and Burning
Man Project is an integral part of the Regional Network program and vital to its success. As an
RC, you are expected to stay in regular communication with the Regional Network Team and
perform the following tasks:
i. Complete the Annual Regional Recap Report (ARRR) and Individual
Self-Assessment Survey – A Region’s ARRR, along with an RC’s Individual
Self-Assessment Survey, help Burning Man Project understand the unique opportunities and
challenges of RCs and regional groups.
● Each RC must complete one Self-Assessment Survey annually, and each RC or RC team
for a Region must complete one ARRR. Links to these two surveys will be sent to your
Burning Man email address towards the end of each calendar year.
● If you have Co-RCs, you must complete your Region’s ARRR in collaboration with them.
ii. Stay current with the Regional Scoop newsletter – The Regional Scoop newsletter is
sent out regularly through the Regional Network announcement list and contains important
information pertaining to the RC role, including key deadlines and deliverable requests. It is
essential that RCs stay informed about these requests throughout the year.
B. Communicate about Burning Man Project: An integral part of your role as a Regional
Contact is sharing information with your local community about Burning Man and Burning
Man-related activities in the Region, including engagement opportunities, application deadlines,
and important news and updates from the organization. As an RC you are expected to:
i. Develop and maintain a working knowledge of Burning Man Project: RCs must
be sufficiently familiar with the structure and activities of the Burning Man organization in
order to effectively facilitate local initiatives and answer questions from their communities.
As an RC, you are expected to:
● Subscribe to and read Burning Man’s Jackrabbit Speaks newsletter
● Familiarize yourself with the content and features of Burning Man’s website
(www.burningman.org)
o When answering questions about Burning Man, aim to direct people to specific pages
of the website and provide links so they can gain a greater context and be inspired
toward further research.
● Attend the Burning Man event in Black Rock City or the closest official Regional event at
least once within each two-year period, and preferably every year, unless the RC and
Regional Network Team agree to a different schedule.

● Read Burning Man Project’s Annual Report to understand the organization’s activities
and the Burning Man AfterBurn Report to understand the event’s production,
infrastructure, and key milestones.
ii. Answer emails about Burning Man – Burning Man Project provides every RC with an
email alias (REGION@burningman.org), which is listed in the Regional Network section of
the Burning Man website, and an individual firstname.lastname@burningman.org email
account. Please use these addresses for all of your RC-related communications.
● An RC is often the first point of contact for local participants, potential participants, and
media outlets. Those who contact an RC might be headed to Black Rock City for the first
time and seeking information from a friendly local Burner, or they might be experienced
Burning Man community members looking to connect with others, or they might simply
be Burning Man-curious.
● You may find it helpful when answering these emails to create a standard response that
can be tailored as needed. The response could include instructions for subscribing to the
Jackrabbit Speaks and joining local announce and discussion lists, links to your Region’s
social media groups or pages, information on upcoming local gatherings, etc.
● RCs aren’t expected to have all the answers about Burning Man! Please contact the
Regional Network team if you need assistance with responding to a particular inquiry, or
if a request seems to be outside the scope of your role as an RC.
iii. Administrate a local event calendar and presence on burningman.org – Each
Region that has an RC also has a page on Burning Man’s website to showcase the local
community. This page includes information on the RC and the community, including how to
subscribe to local lists. In addition, each page contains a calendar for posting events in the
area. An RC administrates the content on this page, including monitoring the events
submitted to the calendar for their interest and appropriateness to the community.
● Notes on the use of images in event listings:
o If a listing includes an image, the RC should confirm that Burning Man has
permission from the copyright owner to use the image, or that the image is in the
public domain, before allowing it to be posted to the public calendar. If you aren’t
sure whether an image can be used by Burning Man Project, please err on the side
of caution and do not use it.
o Whenever possible, the RC should credit the photographer of the image, and if the
image features any artwork, provide credit to the artist(s) as well.
iv. Administrate and moderate an announcement list – You will be responsible for the
announcement list for your Region: [REGION]-announce@burningman.org. This list is an
important tool for keeping the local community notified of events, meetings, collaborative
projects, and other postings of interest to the Burning Man community.
● Events posted to the announcement list need not be limited to official regional events or
Burning Man events. We encourage diversity in the type of information you disseminate.
Anyone can send a post to the list, but each message routes through an RC for
“moderation,” so that an RC may review and approve or decline these posts.
● As an RC, you should avoid posts that are inappropriately personal or politically
partisan. And due to Burning Man’s status as an exempt organization under Internal
Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3), RCs should not make or permit any posts that support
or oppose any candidate for public office anywhere in the world.
● Your announcement list is subject to the Burning Man Project Online Policies, which are
available here.

v. Administrate a discussion list or social media presence (if desired) – Many
communities enjoy the social connectivity that an email discussion list provides. If an RC
chooses, they may establish a list using a free service or run one on their own server. At this
time, Burning Man Project’s server resources are not capable of hosting a discussion list for
every Region, but an RC may list instructions for joining local discussion groups (if
applicable) on the Region’s page of the Burning Man website. Burning Man Project will
consider hosting a Region’s discussion list on the burningman.org mail server on a
case-by-case basis, upon request by the RC and in Burning Man Project’s sole discretion.
● In many areas, discussion is very active and can range off-topic; in others, discussion is
light and limited to Burning Man-related talk. It is up to the local community and the RC
to moderate the discussion list environment to fit their community’s needs and interests.
● An RC may also create a Facebook group or page, Instagram account, Twitter account, or
a presence on other social media channels in accordance with Burning Man Project’s
Online Policies and intellectual property policies. Please avoid using “Burning Man” in
the name of your social media accounts; the preferred naming convention is “[Region]
Burners.”
vi. Adopt a custom version of the Man symbol for your region – Each Region is
encouraged to adopt a Regional variation of the Burning Man symbol/logo to use in
connection with the RC’s activities under this Agreement. Regional logos must be approved
by the Regional Network Team in advance of their use. If your Region does not already use
an approved custom version of the Man, you are encouraged to develop one during your
tenure with guidance from the Regional Network Team.
2. COLLABORATION
A. Help facilitate collaboration in your community: RCs are encouraged to build and
nurture Burning Man communities in their local areas. This often happens organically as people
interact, create, and socialize around projects and events. This does not mean that an RC must
necessarily be the one to start or run such projects or events; rather, an RC should encourage
those who are willing to volunteer their time on community efforts. Knowing the members of the
local community, their interests, and their skills can help facilitate this kind of collaboration
with encouragement from an RC. You will probably find that there are talented people in your
community who have good leadership qualities and skills and are looking for ways to contribute.
Some of them may be interested in starting an art project, creating or sustaining a community
event, or maybe even someday becoming an RC. An RC should seek to cultivate this “next
generation” of leaders. Entry level opportunities to participate locally have to exist so people
may rise to become the leaders of tomorrow.
B. Bring the local community together at least once a year: Face-to-face contact is a vital
part of creating and building community, so every RC is expected to host at least one event for
their Region each year.
● These events need not be large or complex. For example, hosting a simple gathering at a
local coffee shop to share pictures and stories can be a highly effective community-building
endeavor.
● Proceeds from your Regional events, regardless of their size or nature, must be used to
benefit the Regional community and/or the Burning Man community at large – for example,
to seed future Regional events and art projects, fund server space for local websites, award
local art grants and ticket scholarships, or support Burning Man Project programs such as
the Regional Network, Burners Without Borders or Burning Man Arts.

● Any use of the Man symbol or the names “Burning Man,” “Precompression,”
“Decompression,” “Black Rock City” or “Flambé Lounge” in association with a public event
in your Region requires the prior approval of Burning Man Project.
C. Endorse events in your Region for Official Regional Event status, where
appropriate: Burning Man Project will only designate an event as an “Official Burning Man
Regional Event” if a local RC is well-informed about the event and/or actively involved in its
production.
● To apply for official status for any event, the event’s producer must first obtain the
endorsement of at least one RC in the Region. Upon receipt of an application for an event in
your Region, the Regional Network Team will ask for your assessment of whether the
producer’s plans comply with the Criteria for Official Regional Events and the Ten Principles
of Burning Man, based on your knowledge of the Region and the individuals involved.
● If the Regional Network Team approves an event for official status, the event producer(s)
must execute a Regional Event Use Agreement with Burning Man Project. The local RC does
not sign the agreement unless they are also the producer of the event or the producer’s
authorized representative.
● If the RC is not a member of the regional event’s production team, they are expected to
maintain good communication with the event producer(s), provide guidance as appropriate
and necessary regarding compliance with the Criteria and Principles, and keep the Regional
Network Team informed of any concerns.
D. Collaborate with other Regional Contacts: RCs are expected to collaborate with one
another, both within their Region and across the Regional Network.
● If multiple RCs have been designated in a Region, these Co-RCs should coordinate to share
the responsibilities of the RC role. Healthy collaboration includes clear agreement among
Co-RCs about how they will share responsibilities, maintain regular communication, and
participate in any relevant team meetings or community events.
● RCs must subscribe to the Regional Network Discussion List, the primary forum for all RCs
across the network to share ideas, challenges, and success stories with one another. By
contributing their best practices and documentation to the Regional Network Discussion
List, as well as to the Regional Contacts Team Drive, Active Regional Contacts Group of
Burning Man Hive , an RC is helping to strengthen the network.
E. Collaborate with Burning Man Project to address local Decommodification issues:
Guided by the Ten Principles, Burning Man Project protects the core symbols of Burner culture
from being used for commercial purposes or to promote events outside the Regional Network.
The Burning Man symbol (logo), “Burning Man,” “Black Rock City,” “Decompression,”
“Precompression,” and “Flambé Lounge” are protected trademarks. The designs of the Man and
the Black Rock City map, the Ten Principles, and all images taken in Black Rock City are
protected copyrights.
● While serving as an RC, you may become aware of individuals, entities, or events in your
Region that are (intentionally or unintentionally) violating Burning Man’s intellectual
property or image-use policies. An RC will never be asked or expected to take legal action on
behalf of Burning Man Project, but we do encourage you to report potential abuses to
Burning Man’s Intellectual Property Team (ip@burningman.org), and to help us resolve
local Decommodification concerns informally where possible. A gentle explanation of our
policies and Principles is often all that is needed, and the IP Team can provide RCs with
sample language to use.

3. REPRESENTATION
A. Represent Burning Man Project locally: As an RC, you are encouraged to support
acculturation and engagement around Burning Man culture. Your local representation of
Burning Man Project may include participation in public events in your Region, hosting
informational events for new participants, helping new participants prepare for Black Rock City
or their local regional events, and connecting participants with one another. Distributing
information about and within your local Burning Man community can infuse that community
with vital new energy. And by sharing newsletters, videos, “swag” and other materials, an RC
can reach a whole new audience of prospective community members, as well as model the
Burning Man ethos and culture to many who will never attend the event in Black Rock City.
From time to time, and upon request, Burning Man Project may (at its cost) ship these materials
to an RC for distribution at appropriate venues, like a local community center, art school, or
official regional event.
B. Discuss your experiences as an RC with local media: You may represent yourself as an
RC to media outlets in your Region and, in that capacity, describe activities in your area and/or
your personal experiences with or observations about Burning Man, the local community, or
local events. Whenever you are engaging with the media, you must make clear that you are only
speaking from your own perspective and in your capacity as a local RC. Any questions of an
official nature (such as information about the organization or the event in Black Rock City,
including population counts, medical or criminal statistics, personnel issues, etc.) should be
directed to the Regional Network Team, who will involve the Communications Team.
C. Provide conflict support: An RC may be asked to help mediate and work through conflicts
among members of their local community. In these cases, the RC should maintain a neutral
stance, collect as much relevant feedback as possible, and respect confidentiality when
requested. Ideally, the RC will work with the relevant local conduct committees or leadership
teams. Should an RC need help in mediating or working through conflicts, they can escalate to
and request the help of the following groups as appropriate: the Conflict Support Meta Regional
Subcommittee, Regional Network Team, Official Events Team, and the Regional Rangers. Please
refer to the complaint and feedback procedures on the Burning Man website as a guide.
D. Adhere to behavioral standards and avoid conflicts of interest: While serving as an
RC, you are expected to comply with Burning Man’s Behavioral Standards Agreement and
uphold a high standard of ethics, including with respect to conflicts of interest. A conflict of
interest may arise when an RC’s personal interests conflict with their obligation to act in the best
interests of Burning Man Project and/or their local community. A conflict of interest may be
actual, potential or perceived, and may be financial or non-financial. As an RC, you are expected
to:
● Avoid conflicts of interest where possible.
● Identify and disclose any potential conflicts of interest – for example, that the vendor you
are recommending for a regional event is your brother’s company.
● Avoid accepting substantial gifts or favors if the giver seems to be trying to win your
approval or influence.
● Avoid intermingling personal and community monies.
● Recuse yourself from any vote or decision in which you have a personal financial interest.
● Avoid using any information you receive in the course of your work as an RC for your own
advantage or gain.
● Consult with your Co-RCs and the Regional Network Team if you have any concerns about
conflicts of interests (your own or others’).

4. SELF-CARE
A. Commit to taking care of yourself: There is often an assumption that an RC wears all of the
hats and does all of the things. But you should take on only the amount of work that allows you
to sustain yourself in this role. This Schedule lists the key responsibilities of the RC role. Taking
on additional tasks is totally a personal choice for the individual RC. Often, it’s a better choice to
find new and active members of a community to spearhead local initiatives than to do the work
yourself. Burning Man Project cares about the overall health and well-being of all RCs. We seek
to cultivate a culture that encourages all participants to contribute, but in ways that are balanced
and supportive of their overall health and well-being.
5. SUCCESSION
A. Succession planning and resignation from the RC role: When you, as an RC, decide to
step down from the role, you are expected to inform the Regional Network Team and your
Co-RCs, if applicable, in writing. Your resignation should include your reason for stepping down
and your expected resignation date. It is a best practice to give a minimum of six months’ notice
ahead of an expected resignation date. It is also a best practice to collaborate on finding and
training a successor for this role, which includes a smooth transition and hand-off of
responsibilities to a new RC or Co-RCs. Please refer to the Burning Man Project website for
information regarding Intake Processes for New Regional Contacts. An RC who has provided
exemplary leadership and service to their Region for a minimum of two years may be asked to
serve as an Active Alumni. Active Alumni remain on the Regional Network discussion list, if they
want to, and may be asked to help find and mentor new RCs across the network. Active Alumni
may also be asked to contribute to other Regional Network initiatives and provide input on
policies that support the Regional Network’s continued development.

SCHEDULE B:
BURNING MAN’S TEN PRINCIPLES
Radical Inclusion
Anyone may be a part of Burning Man. We welcome and respect the stranger. No prerequisites exist for
participation in our community.
Gifting
Burning Man is devoted to acts of gift giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not
contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value.
Decommodification
In order to preserve the spirit of gifting, our community seeks to create social environments that are
unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. We stand ready to protect our
culture from such exploitation. We resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience.
Radical Self-reliance
Burning Man encourages the individual to discover, exercise and rely on his or her inner resources.
Radical Self-expression
Radical self-expression arises from the unique gifts of the individual. No one other than the individual
or a collaborating group can determine its content. It is offered as a gift to others. In this spirit, the giver
should respect the rights and liberties of the recipient.
Communal Effort
Our community values creative cooperation and collaboration. We strive to produce, promote and
protect social networks, public spaces, works of art, and methods of communication that support such
interaction.
Civic Responsibility
We value civil society. Community members who organize events should assume responsibility for
public welfare and endeavor to communicate civic responsibilities to participants. They must also
assume responsibility for conducting events in accordance with local, state and federal laws.
Leaving No Trace
Our community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our
activities wherever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave
such places in a better state than when we found them.
Participation
Our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change,
whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal
participation. We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play.
We make the world real through actions that open the heart.
Immediacy
Immediate experience is, in many ways, the most important touchstone of value in our culture. We seek
to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves, the reality of those
around us, participation in society, and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers. No idea
can substitute for this experience.

hereunder. This Agreement is personal to you, and your rights and obligations under this Agreement
may not be assigned or subcontracted to any person or entity, without Burning Man’s express written
permission in advance. This Agreement shall bind and be for the benefit of the parties and their heirs,
fiduciaries, successors, and permitted assigns. Subject headings have been inserted for convenience
