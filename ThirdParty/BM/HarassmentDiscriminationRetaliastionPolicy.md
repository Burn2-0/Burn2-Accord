BURNING MAN PROJECT

HARASSMENT, DISCRIMINATION, AND RETALIATION PREVENTION POLICY
Burning Man Project (“Burning Man”) strives to create and maintain a work environment in which
people are treated with decency and respect. The environment of Burning Man should be
characterized by mutual trust; the absence of intimidation, oppression and exploitation; and the ability
to work and learn in a safe, yet stimulating, atmosphere. Burning Man will not tolerate unlawful
harassment or discrimination of any kind. Through enforcement of this Harassment, Discrimination, and
Retaliation Prevention Policy (the “Policy”) and education of employees and volunteers, Burning Man
will seek to prevent, correct and discipline behavior that violates this Policy.
The Policy protects all Burning Man staff members, regardless of position, including independent
contractors, interns, and volunteers (collectively, “staff”). All staff are expected to comply with the Policy
and to take appropriate measures to ensure that prohibited conduct does not occur. Appropriate
disciplinary action will be taken against any staff member who violates this Policy. Based upon the
seriousness of the offense, disciplinary action may include verbal or written reprimand, suspension, or
termination.
A. PROHIBITED CONDUCT
This Policy prohibits all staff from engaging in any form of harassment or discrimination directed at any
employee, intern, volunteer, or independent contractor, including harassment or discrimination on the
basis of race, color, religion (including religious dress or grooming), national origin or ancestry, physical
or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity,
gender expression, sexual orientation, age, military or veteran status, or any other status protected by
applicable federal or state law or local ordinance (“Protected Categories”). This Policy also prohibits
unlawful harassment and discrimination based upon the perception that anyone has any of those
characteristics or is associated with a person who has or is perceived as having any of those
characteristics.
Staff members who make a complaint under this policy, encourage or assist others in doing so,
participate in the investigation of such a complaint, or otherwise oppose conduct that they reasonably
believe violates this Policy have engaged in Protected Activities.
Acts of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation based on a Protected Category or an individual’s
participation in a Protected Activity violate this Policy whether or not those acts rise to the level of
actionable discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. Such violations may result in discipline, up to and
including termination of employment or volunteer opportunities.

1) Harassment
● The definition of harassment is verbal, visual, or physical conduct based on a Protected
Category, which has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's
work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive workingenvironment.
● Examples of harassment prohibited under the Policy include:

○ Verbal: Unwelcome comments, epithets, slurs,or negative stereotyping regarding a
person’s Protected Category.
Nonverbal: Distribution, display or discussion of any written or graphic material that
ridicules, denigrates, insults, belittles, or shows hostility or aversion toward an
individual or group because of their protected class.
Digital: Sending, posting, or sharing negative, harmful, or false content about a
Burning Man staff member via text, in apps, or online in social media, forums, or
anywhere people can view, participate in, or share content electronically.

2) Sexual Harassment
● Sexual harassment in any form is prohibited under the Policy. Sexual harassment includes
unsolicited and unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or
physical harassment of a sexual nature, when such conduct:
○ is made explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment or participation in
volunteer activities;
is used as the basis for an employment decision or a decision affecting volunteer
activities; or
unreasonably interferes with a staff member’s or a volunteer’s performance of work or
volunteer activities, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or otherwise offensive
environment.
● Sexual harassment does not include occasional compliments of a socially acceptable nature
or courteous, mutually respectful, non-coercive interactions that are acceptable to and
welcomed by both parties. Rather, sexual harassment refers to behavior that is unwelcome
and objectively offensive.
Sexual harassment may take different forms. Examples of conduct that may constitute
unwelcome and unlawful sexual harassment are:
●
○ Verbal: Suggestive comments, jokes of a sexual nature, sexual propositions, requests
for any type of sexual favor (this includes repeated, unwelcome requests for dates),
verbal abuse or “kidding” that is oriented toward a prohibited form of harassment and
considered unwelcome.
Nonverbal: Suggestive or insulting sounds, leering, staring, whistling, obscene
gestures, content of a sexual nature in letters, notes, emails, photos, text messages,
internet postings, etc.
Physical: Unwelcome, unwanted bodily contact of any kind, including but not limited to
touching, tickling, brushing up against, hugging, kissing, fondling, or cornering.
Digital: Sending, posting, or sharing suggestive comments, jokes of a sexual nature,
sexual propositions, or requests for any type of sexual favor (this includes repeated,
unwelcome requests for dates) via text, in apps, or online in social media, forums, or
anywhere people can view, participate in, or share content electronically.

3) Discrimination
● It is a violation of the Policy to discriminate in the provision of employment or volunteer
opportunities, benefits, or privileges to any staff member; to create discriminatory work or
volunteering conditions; or to use discriminatory evaluative standards in employment or
volunteer activities for any staff member, if that discriminatory treatment is based in whole or
in part on the individual’s Protected Category.

B. THE COMPLAINT AND REMEDIATION PROCESS

involved, and names of any witnesses.
Managers and other supervisory personnel shall refer any harassment and discrimination complaint to
the People Operations Department, which will undertake a timely, thorough, and objective investigation
of the allegations to the extent that such is necessary and appropriate.

investigation, and will not tolerate or permitretaliation by management or any other staff member.

subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
