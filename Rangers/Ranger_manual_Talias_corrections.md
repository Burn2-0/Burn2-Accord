### Talia Commentary

> Just so you know When Leo first joined Virtual burns.... I was a ranger... with estate privileges.. Which my todays reckoning make me former ranger 007.

>Yes, I am currently Banned...With no Appeals for what was my first offence...
I did not even have an official warning. 
So that was of **100% good standing to 120% Banned** with nothing in-between.

>I invite you to find to find anything in what follows that covers that.

> I am just going to go through and point out the bits that don't quite sit right.

> Maybe drop the occasional bit of extra evidence..

## Introduction

This document and any attachments comprise the written portion of the training and guide for the BURN2 Rangers. Familiarity with the terms, concepts, and practices of the Rangers will make the in-world training and on-playa time more enjoyable and effective. You may want to keep this document handy as you go about your patrols to use as a reference. Rangers, whether they serve in the physical world Burning Man or the virtual BURN2 event, are known for their calm management, analysis, and resolution of interpersonal issues. We welcome your best efforts on behalf of the citizens of BURN2.

> *cough cough* if my resolution of interpersonal issues as a draconian ban then sure... I'll give you that.

### How to Become a Ranger

Burn2 Rangers follow some of the same thinking as BRC Rangers have in place for prerequisites:

- Be active in other departments for at least 1 year, including the Octoburn and at least 2 other weekend-type events.
- Have a recommendation from another Department Lead attesting to the candidate’s reliability, level-headedness, and non-authoritarian approach to situations. [Ranger Self-Quz - Black Rock Rangers](https://rangers.burningman.org/ranger-self-quiz/ "Ranger Self-Quiz")
> Non-authoritarian....Again *cough* Oh I am totally going to point out all of the virtue signalling don't you worry.... 😊

You will then be required to do the following:

- Attend all training sessions. Training is usually held in the spring/summer and then early fall prior to Octoburn. Training is LONG. There is a lengthy manual to be read and reflected upon, which mirrors the BRC Ranger’s manual. There are 4-6 hours of in-world training which includes basic mediation skills. Then there are 4-6 hours of role-play situations which promote problem solving with Ranger tools/special abilities, and collaboration among the Rangers. There is annual training for all Rangers, including Senior Rangers.
  > Now I can't decided whether this is "Omg 4-6hrs. Twice.... Such a drag" or If it's actually thought that that is a long time. 
  > I mean the lead ranger outside of an actual ever Barely logs in... and is talking about intake session of 8-12 hrs.. 
  > That is nothing... 
  > Your average working day is 8.5 hrs... so it's a day work... Think about how much time people put into their Builds over the build periods.. for "EACH" burn but it's made to sound like this was a major issue.... 
  > I am also curious over where the lead ranger acquire her training....
  > I am pretty damn sure it's not from BRC Rangers... "Officially"... 
  
  
- Ideally, the basic training will occur early enough in the summer so that Alpha (new) Rangers have an opportunity to shadow senior Rangers at Conception and/or Virtual Burn events. This provides experience for the Alpha Ranger to make a decision if being a Ranger is a good fit for them. Being a Ranger is not a compatible role for everyone.
- BRC Rangers (after verification of being in good standing) must attend the same training as Alpha Rangers. Once they feel comfortable with the Second Life tools and viewer, and have been active in Burn2 for 1 year, they may be considered “Senior Rangers.”

## History and Role of the Rangers

### Origin of the Black Rock Rangers

The Black Rock Rangers were founded in the physical world environment of Burning Man in 1992 by Danger Ranger; "M2Danger Ranger" in Second Life™ (SL). The Rangers’ initial role was as a desert search-and-rescue organization, which was expanded to the current role of guardians of community standards as the Burning Man community grew. Rangers **_are not a police force_**, but rather a community-based mediation organization whose only authority is that which is granted by the community. Rangers now work at regional Burner events worldwide and in the virtual world of SL's BURN2 (B2). They've now come full circle and span the Multiverse of virtual worlds, blurring all lines.


> Corrections... DR was not the founder he kinda glommed on to an existing thing... People just let him have it so that he won't go on at them... 
> 
> "Are **NOT** A Poliice Force..."    
> Life time ban no appeal...When a ban is apparently "Creative Death". You are right, if you take my case as the example.. Or the numerous others before me.. Then Police force is wrong... "Personal Assassination squad.. " would be a more apt name. 
> 
> "A Community-based Mediation organisation..." 
> Mediation... I seem to remember that that would mean some kind of talking..  Nope didn't get any of that... And community based... When was the last time that there was andt change in certain lead roles... 
> 
> "Whose only authority is that which is granted vy the community"
> Errr yeah I guess if the community walks away they have made rangers the rangers of nothing much in particular... 
> It's called "Social Currency"... If The Ranger Lead had actually looked at the BRC ranger manual.... Social currency is gained my making good calls that people can trust. 
> You can quite easily presume that the overall attendance figures Are a good indicator of what the Balance of Burn2's Account it doing right now.  Last time I bothered to do anything about the stats I think you'd lost 2 in every 5 burners... That is no a healthy Account.

### Role of the BURN2 Rangers

**First and foremost, Rangers are participants in the Burning Man and BURN2 ethos**, perhaps explained best by the [10 Principles](https://www.burn2.org/about/the-ten-principles/ "10 Principles of Burning Man"). From that foundation grows the ego-less helpful actions of a BURN2 Ranger.

>SO Ego-less.... ???
>When was the last time that Leo or iSkye recieved any form of complaint?  At all... 
>Or Did those those complaints suddenly vanish into thin air like the naive idiot who filed them?
> or when did either of them consider standing for election?
> The assumption that they are permanent fixtures and no-one else could even come close to their abilities... Is that Ego-Less?
> I know I am banging on like I deserve stuff too... Did I actually stand to do anything Or did I say I would do what ere was needed. 
> That was an open offer the entire time I was there... I wasn't going to put myself forward for anything cause My self confidence is kinda shot... 
> So what do I deserve? Very next line "the good old 10p." Participation... Radical inclusion.... Community effort... You know the things I tried to promote when I did last years effigy burn... 
> Remember the one where I forced every one out the seats to participate in the crappy story I came up with on the spur of the moment... the lamplighter fire dancers seem to have lost any sense of immediacy, and we so stuck in a rut that they all just sat down. Which is why I had to come up with the story. I had told them a "FEW" times that I was trying to get every one involved and all they had to do was to not sit down... but rather invite people to join them instead... 
> I still have a hard time understanding exactly how doing something that was more in line with the 10p was that difficult... 
> Going on the stony silence for... Well to be honest for me felt like a lifetime.. after I had finish the definition of  of immediacy with a touch of self expression thrown in story... Again not planned for that was my trying to fumble through.  But going on the silence at that point... What were people waiting for? 
> Seriously ask yourself.....
> Raducal self expression, participation, Radical Inclusion and  Communal effert were the main things I was going for..  mostly. I wanted  after the winter vurn where I had been Flycamming through the dram catcher the entire time, getting some good footage and having a blast doing it... I figured maybe people may want the opportunity to do more than sit quietly and watch something  burn... 
> Trust me when I say.... It's not the effigy there that makes that experience special. Note there is not a secret 12th principle of "Pyromancy"




BURN2 Rangers are traditional guardians of the shared values of the Burner community. We are empowered by the community to address concerns, mediate disputes, and resolve conflicts if they cannot be resolved by the participants themselves and, rarely, respond to non-consensual assaults (griefing). Rangers encourage both personal agency and a community of shared responsibility and assist only as needed. **The 11th principle - Consent - applies here, too. Members of the community need to be encouraged to exercise their right to say no, not only to touch, but also to unwanted conversations or discussions.** The role of the Ranger has been aptly described as "riding the edge of chaos."

> *cough cough* mediate.... consent...
> So this is not SL So I am okay sharing this There was one thing that leo said to me that was the single worst thing... I might share the entire of it... But...
> "Please know that many people have logged complaints about your continued harassment. My advice to them is that they block you, and any continued communication be dealt with by filing ARs, and blocking Alts."
> So informing me of people logging complaints, kinda fair but only twice did anyone actually say anything to me... 
> Thank you Leo for highlighting that principle.. Let me teach you how it actually works... 
> *"encouraged to exercise their right"* So this bit... gold star you encouraged people to exercise there right... But...
>  *"to say no,"* I am afraid by forgeting this bit no gold star anymore. 
>  *"not only to touch, but also to"* There are Other things too... 
>   *"unwanted conversations or discussions."* This again feels a bit pointed... 
>>
>   Soo Leo... The actual list... goes something like this... 
>   
>   This comes from the 11thprincuple website.
>   https://www.11thprincipleconsent.org/what-do-you-consent-to/>   
>   - **Touch**: Just because you hugged someone yesterday doesn’t mean you can surprise them with a hug today. “Surprise contact” isn’t always wanted, even if it’s affectionate.
>  - **Kink:** Consent for one thing isn’t consent for another. If I said you can spank me, that doesn’t give you permission to grope me.
>  - **Sex:** Consent can be revoked once it’s been given.
>  - **Gifts:** Disclose what is in your gifts, even if it’s just essential oils. Some people have sensitivities
>  - **Foods:** Disclose the ingredients, one person’s innocuous ingredient can be someone else’s allergy.
>  - **Photography:** Ask before taking pictures. Remember consent to take a picture is NOT consent to post it on your blog.
>  
>   Now it can't just be me whose spider senses are tingling here.. Surely Leo would not have just come up with this addition for her own convenience?
>   https://gyazo.com/68f7dc5de59f0d0ba8cb115af1da8b00
> 
> Ahhh Okayyyy.. So it's just Leo who thinks that this is correct... Maybe the actual rangers have something to say about it... 
> https://gyazo.com/68f7dc5de59f0d0ba8cb115af1da8b00
> .
> ERrm Sooo that is... 
> "**Good communication** is what makes an **organization work** and in most organizations is insufficient. **Most of us don’t communicate the most important things and don’t deal with hard conversations. We choose to gossip or ignore or sweep things under the carpet.**"
> I would love to know what Leo thinks of as an unwanted Conversation... Any thing that questions her divine right of rulership?
> The Real Issue to this in my eyes... is what this actually suggesting... 
> And let me !000% Clear here. I Fully Support The ACTUAL 11th principle. 
> I do think that everyone has the right **to SAY no....**
> However, That conversation was the first time I was made that people had **that** much of an issue. 
> The issue I have with this is that by not saying "**NO**" what does that actually mean... 
> It means the person doesn't know that you have blocked them goes on for ages thinking that "Oh they are probably just busy with something... and then what? Next time they see each other do you thing that is going to me an easier to deal with situation? A social meetup where it's suddenly reveals that someone has blocked some... Fun.... 
> Then.... Lets go back to the 10p... Radical self expression for starters... Obviously that is tempered by Civic responsibility.. With both sides.. So one might say something you don't like It's their right to say it it's your right to walk away and not be in the conversation. It's a civic responsibility to not do that it a way that leaves the other person unaware. Why?
>Well if you don't like what is being said and you thing it's likely that others wouldn't. They just walking away is passing the responsibility onto someone else... that is very much passing the buck. 
>The 11th principle should not Twisted into something that supersedes any of the others just to protect one persons ego.
>Then for one final and absolute, SERIOUSLY LEO WTF!!!....  
>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech
>So please Leo... explain for me....  or do you refuse your consent to have the conversation to defend this?



Rangers on duty interact with participants on a personal level. Rangers are the most visible part of our organization during the event, and often the first (and possibly only) contact for participants with BURN2 staff. They are often the first responders to a situation. While on patrol, you will keep moving around the estate. Meet and greet your fellow participants… you are part of the BURN2 community. Stop in for a campfire chat at a nice-looking camp. Whether you are a seasoned veteran or a first-time Ranger, your presence and the other participants’ perceptions of you are valuable team assets. If a problem occurs later, you may have already developed a relationship with the participants involved.

## Ranger Code of Behavior

**THIS IS IMPORTANT - STRICTLY ENFORCED**
>pfhhtt

A Ranger is expected to be unfailingly honest, from which all other expectations derive. Do what you say you’ll do. Honor the Ranger role you've taken. Rangers on duty are expected to behave in a manner that expresses the best of Second Life, BURN2, and Burning Man. The following may result in ejection from the Ranger team:

- Losing self-control
> Well either my ban was intentional and you've never been able to defend it.. or you lost control..
- Misusing your special role or role abilities by throwing your weight around
> Again... issued two complaints... 3 days later perma ban and complaints go bye bye....
> Do I really need to say more... 
- Making demands or making threats and acting unprofessionally
> I would say that a ban is a form of demmand...... 
- Resorting to acts of humiliation or intimidation or taunting or mocking others
> Yup I totally get the humiliation this must be for you Leo... and yeah I am totally mocking  you here...  I've dealt with it from you since sl20b potentially.
- Abusing the community’s trust
> The Ranger lead that doesn't know the ranger ways? You mean something like that?
- Blogging, tweeting, or otherwise publicly posting privileged information. This includes Facebook, GTalk, Skype, Discord, and other social media status updates.
> Got nothing...unless I was meant to be similaritires to a certain political group secret?
- Terms of Service and Community Standards violations found to be true
> You publicly on record outed one of my ALTs... That m'dear is a CS violation... 
- Sexual harassment or misconduct
- Rangering while altered - drunk or stoned
> I don't really know why you bother with this one...  "Hey, I need you to pee on the monitor for me..."

 - Assault or any other acts of violence
 > Like a ban you mean?
- Knowingly neglecting a big problem. Alert others if you can’t deal with it! Yes, just kick it sideways.
> OMFG... the number of time I have brought this up.... 
> BLOCKING == KNOWINGLY NEGLECTING A PROBLEM.

Harassment is defined as any unwelcome verbal (text or voice chat) or physical conduct engaged in with another avatar. Harassment in any form can and will get you removed from the Ranger cadre and possibly even the BURN2 sims. This includes aggressive, combative, confrontational, or offensive behavior; unwanted sexual advances, spanking, or biting. And, if someone tells you to stop, do so immediately. Also, silence is NOT consent! If you attempt to interact with someone and he or she ignores you, stop.

**Silence is _NOT_ _consent._**

> Sooo you realise this is against the 10p and Logic in general right?
> If talking with people requires their consent... and there silence is not consent... Does that not just leave the entire sim in silence because no one can ask consent becuase no one is actuall able to talk without gaining consent..  

### Volunteer Rights & Responsibilities

All BURN2 volunteers should read over the rights and responsibilities section of the BURN2 web site: [https://www.burn2.org/who-is-burn2/we-are-volunteers/](https://www.burn2.org/who-is-burn2/we-are-volunteers/ "Volunteer Rights and Responsibilities").

### If You Have a Problem

If you, as a Ranger, either on shift or not, have a problem on playa or with another Ranger, here are some ways you can get assistance.

First, remember that as a Ranger, you, too, are part of the BURN2 community. You can ask for Ranger assistance, just like everyone else. If you get into a situation in which you feel you are in over your head or things are getting out of control, call for help. DON'T let things escalate by trying to handle them yourself. You have special role powers others don't have, even if you are not wearing your Ranger group tag. These special role powers can be very destructive. No one is going to think any less of you for asking for help. And, if you make a mistake or have an accident that affects someone else, 'fess up to the Khaki or a Ranger Lead immediately so we can assist in mediating the situation. _Your actions on playa, even when you're off duty, reflect on the entire B2 Rangers organization_.

Second, if you have an issue or a disagreement with another Ranger, take it to IM or private voice chat. Do NOT use local chat, local voice chat, any group chat (including BURN2 Rangers group and the Ranger Discord Channel), radio chat, or group notices. _**No one needs to see or hear Rangers arguing in public.**_ This makes all of us look bad. It is perfectly acceptable to disagree with another Ranger in private, but please, keep it respectful. We are all volunteers; we are all here working together for the betterment of the BURN2 community. Keep the goals of the community in mind.

If you cannot come to an agreement with the other Ranger, either civilly agree to disagree and move on, or take your dispute to the Ranger Leads for mediation assistance and/or the BURN2 Regional Contacts (3vilyn). You may be advised to take it up the ladder, and the Regional Contact can provide you the method to make that contact. Explain your side of the story. Provide as much detail as you feel comfortable providing. Take the rest of your shift off if you need some down time. Remember, we're all here to have fun.

And, if Khaki or a Lead tells you to take a break, please do so. Please do not argue about it, even if you feel the request is unreasonable. Just step aside, go to your home off playa, meet with friends, or log off your computer, whatever you need. Take a break. Come back in an hour or two or even the next day, if necessary. Your well-being is important, too, and if your stress levels are high, you're not doing anybody any good; especially yourself. If you think the request is unreasonable, present your case at a later time to the Rangers Lead or a Regional Contact.

If you have an issue with Ranger Leadership, PLEASE TALK TO ANOTHER RANGER LEAD OR TO A BURN2 REGIONAL CONTACT!!!

> And if you happen to have a problem with the ranger lead... then you are screwed... 
> If you make a complaint everything goes deathly quite for around 3 days... and then the regional contact that appears to be so under the thumb of either leo or m2 will send you a ban notice that is against the policies of burning to do. 
*> "Burning Man will not retaliate against any individual for filing a complaint or participating in an investigation, and will not tolerate or permitretaliation by management or any other staff member."*
Harassment Discrimination and Retaliation Prevention Policy



Okay just swing back to the complaint over four hours... It's taken me that one to get here... To actually untangle the twisted mess of this that Leo has made of it... I will continue this but I was acutally perparing a meesage about "Stuff" when I noticed that thte rules had meen changed... So I just HAD to take a look to see how bad thing could have been messed up and, yeah, as badly as expected... I must admit I didn't expect the human rights violation quite that quitckly.... wasn't unexpected though..
