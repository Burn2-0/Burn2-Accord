		<li _ngcontent-c23=""><b _ngcontent-c23="">processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner.</b> We must always have a lawful basis to process personal data, as set out in the data protection laws.

		<li _ngcontent-c23=""><b _ngcontent-c23="">collected only for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes.</b> Personal data must not be collected for one purpose and then used for another. If we want to change the way we use personal data, we must first tell the data subject.</li>
		<li _ngcontent-c23=""><b _ngcontent-c23="">processed only where it is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes of processing.</b> We will only collect personal data to the extent required for the specific purpose notified to the data subject.</li>
