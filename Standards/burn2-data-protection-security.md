Data Protection Principles

Personal data may be processed as necessary to perform a contract with the data subject, to comply with a legal obligation which the data controller is the subject of, or for the legitimate interest of the data controller or the party to whom the data is disclosed. The data subject must be told who controls the information (us), the purpose(s) for which we are processing the information and to whom it may be disclosed.
		collected only for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes. Personal data must not be collected for one purpose and then used for another. If we want to change the way we use personal data, we must first tell the data subject.
		processed only where it is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes of processing. We will only collect personal data to the extent required for the specific purpose notified to the data subject.

Data Impact Assessments


	Some of the processing that the Employer carries out may result in risks to privacy.
	Where processing would result in a high risk to Staff rights and freedoms, the Employer will carry out a data protection impact assessment to determine the necessity and proportionality of processing. This will include considering the purposes for which the activity is carried out, the risks for individuals and the measures that can be put in place to mitigate those risks.


Data Breaches


	If we discover that there has been a breach of Staff personal data that poses a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, we will report it to the Information Commissioner within 72 hours of discovery.
	We will record all data breaches regardless of their effect in accordance with our Breach Response Policy.
	If the breach is likely to result in a high risk to your rights and freedoms, we will tell affected individuals that there has been a breach and provide them with more information about its likely consequences and the mitigation measures it has taken.




Individual Responsibilities


	Staff are responsible for helping the Employer keep their personal data up to date.
	Staff should let the Employer know if personal data provided to the Employer changes, e.g. if you move house or change your bank details.
	You may have access to the personal data of other Staff members and of our customers in the course of your employment. Where this is the case, the Employer relies on Staff members to help meet its data protection obligations to Staff and to customers.
	Individuals who have access to personal data are required:
	
		to access only personal data that they have authority to access and only for authorised purposes;
		not to disclose personal data except to individuals (whether inside or outside of the Employer) who have appropriate authorisation;
		to keep personal data secure (e.g. by complying with rules on access to premises, computer access, including password protection, and secure file storage and destruction);
		not to remove personal data, or devices containing or that can be used to access personal data, from the Employer's premises without adopting appropriate security measures (such as encryption or password protection) to secure the data and the device; and
		not to store personal data on local drives or on personal devices that are used for work purposes.
