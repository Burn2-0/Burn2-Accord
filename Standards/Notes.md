# Talia's Notes on these documents

A list of considerations:

* First of I am fully aware that I am doing this off my own back and it may not be used. 
* What relation are Rangers and Lamplighters to Burn2? Like seriously. If they are entirely separate organizations that would mean that everything you need for Burn2.org, that will be required in triplicate.
* Roles. For certain there will need to be at least one role created for "Data Controller".
* By-Laws. It would be really nice to have access to by-laws so I don't unintentionally contradict anything.  But it looks like the response to this is "no, blissful ignorance in King."
