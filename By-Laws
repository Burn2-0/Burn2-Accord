Unless changed by the Board, the fiscal year of the corporation shall begin on
January 1 and end on December 31 of each year.
[copied from the old unapproved B2 bylaws…]
Section 6.02. Checks, Drafts, Etc. All checks, orders for the payment of money, bills of lading,
warehouse receipts, obligations, bills of exchange, and insurance certificates shall be signed or
endorsed by such officer or officers or agent or agents of the Corporation and in such manner as
shall from time to time be determined by resolution of the Board of Directors or of any committee to
which such authority has been delegated by the Board.
Section 6.03. Deposits and Accounts. All funds of the Corporation, not otherwise employed, shall
be deposited from time to time in general or special accounts in such banks, trust companies, or
other depositories as the Board of Directors or any committee to which such authority has been
delegated by the Board may select, or as may be selected by the President or by any other officer or
officers or agent or agents of the Corporation, to whom such power may from time to time be
delegated by the Board. For the purpose of deposit and for the purpose of collection for that
account of the Corporation, checks, drafts, and other orders of the Corporation may be endorsed,
assigned, and delivered on behalf of the Corporation by any officer or agent of the Corporation.
Section 6.04. Investments. The funds of the Corporation may be retained in whole or in part in
cash or be invested and reinvested on occasion in such property, real, personal, or otherwise, or
stock, bonds, or other securities, as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may deem

by law regarding such investments, and which are permitted to organizations exempt from Federal
income taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

### Section 2 Conflicts of Interest.

Board members and committee members must actively seek to avoid situations
and activities that create an actual or potential conflict between the individual’s
personal interests and the interests of the corporation. If a Board member or
committee member believes that a conflict exists relative to a particular issue
being considered by the Board or any committee, he or she shall disclose the
conflict to the Board or committee, as appropriate, and abstain from discussion
or voting on the issue.
For purposes of this section and these bylaws, a “conflict of interest” means a
situation in which a board or committee member is part of a discussion or
decision by the board or a committee which has the potential to financially
benefit that board or committee member or a member of that board or
committee member’s immediate family. “Immediate family” means, spouse or
same-sex/domestic partner, children, parents, siblings, parents-in-law, or
siblings-in-law.
Both the fact and the appearance of a conflict of interest should be avoided.
Board members or committee members who are unsure as to whether a certain
transaction, activity, or relationship constitutes a conflict of interest should
discuss it with the President, who will determine whether disclosure to the Board
or the assistance of legal counsel is required. A Regional Contact who is also a
Board Member would have a conflict of interest from answering to both Burn2
and BMorg.

intellectual property belonging to the corporation without the prior approval of
the Board memorialized in a writing signed by the President.
