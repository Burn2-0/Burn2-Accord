Got it. I read the whole draft. Here are the big rocks to fix first (legal/compliance), then governance/clarity tweaks, then quick patch text you can drop in.

# Priority issues (fix these before adoption)

1. **Principal office is “in Second Life”.**
   California law expects a real-world principal office where records are kept and for service of process; a virtual sim is not acceptable. Keep the sim as your community hub, but name a physical principal office (or “principal office in California” plus a records custodian address). ([calcorporatelaw.com][1])

2. **Annual report is sent to directors, not members.**
   Public-benefit corps with members must send the annual report to **members** within 120 days of fiscal year end, and also deliver the “statement of certain transactions and indemnifications”. Your Article XI §4/§5 limits this to directors. Change to “members and directors”. ([FindLaw Codes][2])

3. **“Committees of the Board” are composed of one director + members.**
   Not allowed if the committee has board authority. California Corporations Code §5212 requires **two or more directors** on any committee that exercises board authority; otherwise it must be an **advisory** committee with no board powers. Adjust composition or rename those committees as advisory. ([Justia Law][3])

4. **Officer titles: make Treasurer = Chief Financial Officer.**
   The code requires the corporation to have a president (or chair), a secretary, and a **treasurer or chief financial officer**. Best practice: state explicitly that “the Treasurer is the Chief Financial Officer for purposes of §5213”. Also ensure the Secretary and CFO are not the same person as the President/Chair. ([Justia Law][4])

5. **Board voting thresholds conflict.**
   §V.7.F says board actions pass by simple majority of directors present; §V.7.L says proposals need **two-thirds** of directors present. Pick one rule (or carve-outs) and delete the conflicting sentence. If you want 2/3 for big items, list them.

6. **Electronic/written ballots for members: minor cross-ref + rules.**
   Your §IV.20 refers to “Section 12(e)” (doesn’t exist). Fix the pointer and keep the §5513 rules: disclose quorum needed, approval threshold, closing time, ballots irrevocable, and file ballots for 3 years. You mostly have this right; just fix the citation. ([Farella Braun + Martel LLP][5])

7. **Member discipline process: add statutory guardrails.**
   California requires notice at least 15 days before the effective date and an opportunity to be heard at least 5 days before; your 15/10 windows are OK, but the line “decision is final” is risky (members still have legal remedies). Also state that the standard is “fair and reasonable, carried out in good faith,” and that the rules are either in the bylaws (they are) or provided annually. ([National Law Review][6])

8. **49% interested-person limit missing.**
   Add a clause that not more than 49% of directors may be “interested persons” (paid staff/contractors or their close relatives) to satisfy §5227 and AG expectations. ([Justia Law][7])

9. **Audit/Audit Committee trigger not addressed.**
   If BURN2 ever hits \$2m+ gross revenue (excl. most gov grants), you must obtain an independent audit and have an audit committee with specific composition limits. Put a conditional clause in now so you do not trip the Act later. ([California DOJ][8])

10. **Principal office + records location cross-links.**
    Where you say records “shall be stored in a location designated by the Board”, tie that to the principal office requirement (or name both: principal office + designated records repository). ([California DOJ][9])

# Governance and clarity (high impact, not strictly legal)

* **Member proxies banned + 1/3 quorum default.**
  Banning proxies is allowed, but with a one-third quorum you risk paralysis or rule-by-the-hardcore. Consider allowing proxies or keeping the electronic-ballot fallback prominent. ([Public Counsel][10])

* **Closed meetings power is too broad.**
  “K. Any meeting may be closed by the President” invites abuse. Require a board vote to enter executive session and minute the reason (personnel, litigation, member discipline, etc.), with decisions recorded.

* **Quorum language for the board.**
  “An odd-number majority of the authorised number of directors” is odd wording. Use “a majority of the authorised number of directors constitutes a quorum.”

* **Membership criteria.**
  “Must have read the annual report” is practically unenforceable. If you need engagement, require acknowledgement of receipt instead.

* **Removal of directors by members “with cause only”.**
  The law permits removal without cause; your stricter rule is permissible but reduces accountability. Decide deliberately. ([Epsten, APC][11])

* **Discipline scope vs access.**
  You flag uncertainty on “Access to sim/Discord?”. Clarify that suspension/expulsion affects membership rights and specify who can restrict event/server access and for how long (Rangers for immediate safety removals; board for membership sanctions).

* **IP ownership is over-broad for a volunteer art community.**
  If you want to avoid alienating creators, switch to contributor licences (non-exclusive licence to use/display/stream) unless there is a paid commission with an assignment.

* **Typos / drafting debris.**
  Delete bracketed editorial notes (e.g., “\[Important change…]”, “STOPPED HERE”), fix “as needed byas needed by”.

# Drop-in fixes (copy/paste, minimal surgery)

**Principal Office (replace Article II §1):**
“The principal office for the transaction of the activities and affairs of BURN2 shall be in the State of California at a physical street address designated by the Board. The corporation may also maintain virtual locations (including in Second Life) for community activities. The Secretary shall maintain the current principal office address and agent for service of process in the corporate records.” ([calcorporatelaw.com][1])

**Annual Reports (replace Article XI §§4–5):**
“Not later than 120 days after the close of each fiscal year, the Board shall cause an annual report to be sent to **all members and directors** in accordance with Corporations Code §6321. The corporation shall also prepare and deliver the **annual statement of certain transactions and indemnifications** to **members and directors** pursuant to §6322.” ([FindLaw Codes][2])

**Board Committees (replace Article VII §2 first two paras):**
“The Board may create one or more **committees of the Board**, each consisting of **two or more directors**, to serve at the pleasure of the Board and exercise the authority of the Board to the extent permitted by Corporations Code §5212. Committees that include non-directors are **advisory committees** and shall not exercise the authority of the Board.” ([Justia Law][3])

**Interested-Person Limit (new Article V §2.C):**
“Not more than **49 percent** of the persons serving on the Board may be ‘interested persons’ as defined in Corporations Code §5227.” ([Justia Law][7])

**Officers (tweak Article VI §1):**
“…The elected officers shall be a President (or Chair), Secretary, and **Treasurer (who shall be the Chief Financial Officer for purposes of §5213)**.” ([Justia Law][4])

**Member Discipline (replace last sentence of IV §6.C):**
“…The Board shall decide whether the member is to be suspended, expelled, or otherwise sanctioned. Any action shall be **fair and reasonable, carried out in good faith**, and consistent with these bylaws and applicable law.” ([National Law Review][6])

**Audit trigger (new Article XI §6):**
“If the corporation’s gross revenues equal or exceed **\$2,000,000** (excluding qualifying government grants), the corporation shall obtain an independent audit and maintain an **audit committee** meeting the requirements of California Government Code §12586(e).” ([California DOJ][8])

**Board Voting (clean conflict in V.7.F/L):**
Pick one:

* “Except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, actions of the Board require the affirmative vote of a **majority** of directors present at a meeting with a quorum.” **or**
* “Actions of the Board require the affirmative vote of **two-thirds of the directors present** at a meeting with a quorum.”
  Delete the other sentence.

If you want, I can run a fast redline of your text with these exact edits applied, and add a short “member-safe discipline SOP” plus an executive-session policy. This keeps it compliant and stops drama before it starts.
