## ...but Constructive

> This is how to do Constructive Critique: Yes I tore into the meetings and was very negative. But I make a suggestion to put in their place, I show I've listened to people and even taken a suggestion from some one else and ran with it. I have a personal rule that I won't complain about stuff unless I am willing to put in 100% of the work to change it myself. And I won't complain unless I have to my mind a viable alternative. This worked great for me but when put up against being placed last in a meeting... That led to "Moan moa.. Call for Adjournment, Seconded.... But but.." I hadn't got the the alternative and I knowing the time constraint wouldn't both with the shit sandwich method.

## Shit Sandwich

> Just in case peolple are not aware of the shit sandwich thing. This is how given enough time I would have wanted to make my "Complaints".

1. Open up with an acknowledge of something going right, a postive thing.
2. Make the actual complaint.
3. Finish off with a positive way to move forwards.  Make sure it shows that you have listened to others with features, codenames, easter eggs that directly reference things that others have said.
4. Then SHUT THE F UP. Listen to what people say. At most make small amendments to the suggestion but listen, take notes.

> That is what I mean by shit sandwich. Given the chance to speak fully  every negative would be book ended with a positive from the past and a positive moving fowards. It's a framwork designed to make the shit more palatable...  A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down to put it another way.
