> I would seriously question the independence of Lamp Lighters group when their leadership mirrors Burn2's and would recommend that they are either considered a subgroup whilst their leadership is in a majority the same as Burn2 or to be recognised as a independent group that they make appropriate changes to leadership.  
> > The Main issue with this is that in this current state they can be used as leverage providing those that are members additional benefits or the appearance of. That leverage goes both ways. They very much appear to anyone on the outside a Clique. With a lack of transparency in terms of signing up.  
> > E.g. it wasn't taken well when I pointed out that Burn2.tv were very much like like Lamp Lighters. Just where Lamplighters lit paraffin lamps to guide Burners at the Burn back to their camps. B2.TV however lit the screens of many potential virtual burners showing them how to find their way to their Virtual Home at Burn2 itself.)
