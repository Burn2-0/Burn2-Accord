# Department Builds

-[home](/README.md)-[up](/Draft/Drafts.md)-[index](index.md)-

> Another Recommendation each department/sub-group/indy Group should have infrastructure to build out. Filling out entire sims with just plots.. then last second adding a rangers station is not ideal. What I would probably suggest is that each group/department have a larger 1024 max primary build, then either or both a much smaller single build or placeable "flavour items". Table below purely as an example.

|dept/group|main|minor|flavour|
|---|---|---|---|
|VOLUNTEER COORDINATION|_FLAMBE LOUNGE?_|_RIDE ALONG MEETUP POINT?_|_BURN2 NEEDS YOU POSTERS?_|
|DMV|_DMV YARD?_|_BP HELL?_|ART CAR REZZERS|
|DPW|_CONTAINER ZERO?_|METRICS SYSTEM|SIGN POSTS. _POSTAL SERVICE?_|
|COMMUNICATIONS|_MEDIA MECCA?_|_WHAT IS HAPPENING BOARDS?_|_NEWS PAPER DISPENSORS?_|
|GREETERS|MAIN GATE|_REALITY CHECK-POINTS (aid stations)?_|_PHONE BOOTH?_|
|PERFORMANCE|CENTER CAMP|_DEEP PLAYA STAGE?_|CAMP RADIOS|
|ART DEPT|HEARTERY|_WELL THAT WAS UNEXPECTEDS?_|PORTAPOTTIES|
|FASHIONISTA|FASHIONISTA STAGE|_CHANGEING ROOM?_|_AFFIRMATION MIRRORS?_|
|RANGERS|RANGER HQ|RANGER OUTPOSTS|PANIC BUTTONS|
|LAMP LIGHTERS|LAMP LIGHTER VILLAGE|_DRUM CIRCLES?_|SPIRES|
|BURNERS WO BORDERS|_AUDITORIUM?_|_WORLD MAP?_|_REGIONAL INFO SIGNS?_|
|BURN TV|_BURNTV TRANSMISSION RV?_|_CINEMA? DRIVE IN?_|_TV PILES?_|
