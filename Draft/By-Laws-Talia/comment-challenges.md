Given all the above.. it shouldn't be a massive shock that I think I could easily "Out Ranger", the current ranger lead. Not that I want the role. O just think  that I could do a better job.  
Hell, anyone with the ability to read the rules, to have the ability to trust that the rules are there for a purpose and even if difficult  or hard they should be followed as they are there so that the best outcome can be achieved by following them. And finally that they have the compassion and empathy enough to put others  before themselves.
Not exactly a high bar for being able to do better eh?
I have a hard time reading through the rules, regulations and guidelines of burn2 or rangers where  where I can't suggest events where certain leads have not lived up the the high ideals or just done the opposite of what is written...
My best guess as to why they even bother with having these rules is just virtue signalling. "Oh I am a lead at burn2 and we stick to these rules.".
But what happens if someone decides to point out that something about those rules were not followed?
Life time ban no discussion..?
Is that  reasonable punishment? My Crimes:

* **"personally directed attacks"** (my recounting a particularly harrowing harassment event. ).
* **Posting information on behalf of a banned character**, (reposting open letters that were a previously banned friend trying to get their side of the story heard.).
* **Disturbing the Planning meeting by requesting more than one thing.** (I was the only person to have been restricted to one thing per meeting, The incident in this claim was when I said what I had in my backlog not what I was attempting to have added to the meeting. My backlog was that full because of the restriction and the fact that everything I put in at meetings would be posted last on the agenda and and if the meeting did actually get to me 50/50.. the chances of my topic being resolved before someone decided to called "motion to adjourn.."  was maybe 1 in 15...).
* **Community disruption**: I had upset people with my being upset with the way I was being treated....  Need I say more.
* And then finally that I had been **warned by a ranger** to reel  things in... (Neither me or the ranger considered that an official warning. They had  specifically said that it was not to rangers. )
