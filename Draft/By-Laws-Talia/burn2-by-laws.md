-[home](/README.md)-[up](/Draft/Drafts.md)-[index](index.md)-

## Article I : Name

The name of this organization shall be Burn2 Regional.

## Article II : Purpose

The purpose of this organization is to foster a community based on the Ten Principles of Burning Man, facilitating creative expression, and ensuring a safe, inclusive, and engaging virtual experience. We aim to comply with all of our own polices and guidelines, Burning Man polices, rules and principles and Second Life's terms of service, privacy policy, community standards and all other policies.

### **Core Principles:**

* Radical Inclusion (welcome and respect for all)
* Gifting (acts of unconditional gift giving)
* Decommodification (no commercial sponsorships or transactions)
* Radical Self-reliance (individuals discover, exercise, and rely on inner resources)
* Radical Self-expression (unique gifts offered as a gift to others)
* Communal Effort (creative cooperation and collaboration)
* Civic Responsibility (responsible public welfare and communication of civic responsibilities)
* Leaving No Trace (environmental respect and cleanup after activities)
* Participation (radically participatory ethic, everyone is invited to work and play)
* Immediacy (overcoming barriers for immediate experience)
* Consent (respect for autonomy, boundaries, and informed consent in all interactions)

## Article III: Membership

### Requirements

Our main group is open-access, radically inclusive, and a source of immediate information on how to participate further. Membership to all groups within Burn2 is based on the understanding that all other Burners, our principles, rules, and the principles and rules of Burning Man are respected.

### Further Participation

Those who choose to gift their time and skills by volunteering or self-express through art, performances, or building camps may gain access to additional groups with extended privileges and abilities. However, it is understood that those with these privileges have a civic responsibility not to abuse them.

### Be Aware

Please keep in mind that there may be aspects of our community that you do not agree with or appreciate. As long as it is within the spirit, principles and rules please try respect the right of others to self-express the way they choose to. Burn2 will strive to provide alternatives whenever possible. Alternatively, this might be an opportunity for you to exercise your Burner spirit of self-reliance and immediacy, gifting your time and skills to participate and provide your self-expression as a gift to the community.

If you are unsure about how to proceed or need guidance on getting involved, please look for a well seasoned Burner (They have the most burns and least eyebrows!). They can point you in the right direction.

### Subgroups and Departments

The following subgroups and departments are recognized:

* THE BEACONS (see Article IV)
* BURN2 Departments:  
  * VOLUNTEER COORDINATION  
  * DMV  
  * DPW  
  * COMMUNICATIONS  
  * GREETERS  
  * PLACEMENT

## Article IV: Beacon Council

### **Composition:**

**The Beacon Council shall consist of 5 members, including:**  

* M2 (owner of the Sim)  
* Highest Authority from BRC Besides M2 ( Normally 3V Regional Coordinator from BRC )  
* Three additional members voted into their positions by the community  

**Terms:** M2 as owner, term finishes upon retirement. 3V as RC to be determined by BRC. The Additional three serve one year terms but Continue those terms if they stand unopposed. If a Beacon has 3 valid Complaints against them or there is a majority petition by active burners (measured my login within the last 3 months.) Then the next Beacon meet should be public and Needs to resolve the issue in a manner that gains a Quorum and Has Majority Agreement from Burners Present at the meeting.  
**Training:** Ideally before taking their position Beacon should either have time served as a Ranger or if they have no Ranger training they should be allowed to train as a ranger but not be required to serve as one.  
**Quorum:** A quorum for Beacon meetings shall be 3 members.  
**Meetings:** The Beacon Council shall meet quarterly with at least 7 days' notice. Minutes of these meetings are public record.  
**Crown:** A Crown is chosen from the community to take minutes, Each burner may only serve once per year.

## Article V: Leads & Leadership

The organization has several leads for each subgroup and department:

### Departments

    * BURN2 VOLUNTEER COORDINATION
    * BURN2 DMV
    * BURN2 DPW
    * BURN2 COMMUNICATIONS
    * BURN2 GREETERS
    * ~BURN2 PLACEMENT~
    * BURN2 PERFORMANCE
    * BURN2 ART DEPT

Each of the above should ideally have at least one lead. Those leads to be picked by the Beacons with Quorum and under advisement of the currently existing leads.. Leads Picked from those who apply. Beacons and especially VC but all other leads should be on the look for bright sparks who need a little tinder and kindling and should suggest they apply for any empty positions. A reason why they make the suggestion should be recorded with the name of the Beacon/Lead and the applicant.  
Co-leads should also be aimed for but ideally not from pre-existing leads unless it's with someone that is green to being a lead and needs guidance.

### Sub-Groups

    * BURN2 RANGERS
    * BURN2 FASHIONISTAS

Leadership of the groups does remain up to them. The Beacons should be able to trigger a vote of no confidence either through excessive complaints, resignations or if Rangers themselves by majority petition request that a vote should take place.  
Rangers are Burners before they are rangers. Therefore it's Burn2's civic responsibility to step in to protect a burner.  
No ranger should feel the need to leave if they disagree with way rangers are being led. If the situation has got to the point of "My way or the highway.". That would suggested that leads are going against ranger training. Remember the key points to remember from training? "Rangering is NOT about you." If a ranger is left at a point where the highway is their only option that would mean the Lead has made it all about themselves, and that they are not willing to Listen or Mediate and that being a basic ranger skill that renders them unfit for duty.

### Independent Recognised Group

    * THE LAMP LIGHTERS
    * BURNERS WITHOUT BORDERS
    * BURN2.TV (SUP)

Being an Independent Recognised Group infers a long term collaborative partnership. Burn2 recognises the value each of these groups brings to the table, Be it a show of self expression or the outreach providing the chance to radically include more Burners. Burn2 will aid these groups in the completion of their chosen goals.  
This aid is a gift, in thanks for providing an example of the principles implemented well. This gift should be open to all to apply who think that their communities efforts exemplify either parts of or all of the principles.

For all sub-groups and independent groups, A record of the current leadership should be on record with the Beacons. There should also be a record of any commitments made by either side.

## Article VI: Crowns

(Firstly, Named Crowns for the Breakout fires in Forest Fires not due to royalty or status.)

The Beacon Council may establish committees as needed to carry out the organization's work. Each committee shall report to the Beacon Council and operate within the scope defined by the Council.

## Article VII: Conflict Resolution

**Procedure:**  
Conflicts shall be reported to Rangers, who will facilitate mediation to resolve issues amicably.  
**Escalation:**  
If mediation fails, the issue may be brought to the Beacon Council for a final decision. Requires a quorum.

### **Complaints Process**

* Official complaints should not be closed. There should always be a method to hold Beacons, Leads, and other Burners accountable.
* Complaints shall be considered by incident, not by number of complaints. This is to prevent abuse of the three strikes system.
* When a complaint is filed the following people should be made aware.  
  * The Beacons - One of whom should decide if it is safe to inform the respondent/s. All complaints go to All Beacons however.  
  * The Lead/s Ranger - Who should if deemed necessary and in agreement with a beacon put measures in place for when the respondent/s is informed. Deciding vote from another beacon  
  * The Complainant/s - so that they know that the complain has been received.  
  * The Respondent/s - After measures in place if deemed necessary.  
    * This should not take longer than 24hrs from the receipt of the complaint.
* The Rangers are responsible for guiding the complaints process in accordance with the guidelines provided below:  
  * A complaint can only be brought against any Burner, be they Lead, Volunteer, Ranger, Beacon or what ever if they have failed to comply with the Bylaws. The Bylaws by association include Burn2, Burning Man and Second Life's rules and regulations.  
  * All parties involved must be given the opportunity to provide their side of the story. The Rangers Current Guidelines cover this.

### Recommended Protocols

* The following recommendations for dealing with issues by the rangers.  
  * Specific abilities:  
  * Rangers should have the ability:  
    * to ban for periods of up to **2 hrs** and to reapply that **3 times** per offense.  
    * to return items in a situation of griefing or other attack/harassment.  
  * The Lead, Khaki or a single 007 should have the ability:  
    * to ban for up **2 days** and reapply that **3 times** per offense.  
    * to return items in a situation of griefing or other attack/harassment.  
  * A Ranger Lead and two 007 in agreement:  
    * to ban for up **1 week** and reapply that **3 times** per offense.  
    * to return all items of the offender  
    * to remove the offender from all groups except for the main one.  
    * removal from the main one is acceptance if the offender causes continued issues.  
  * All actions above should be logged and made available to the beacons on request.  
* Exceptions:  
  * Other properties, For example Websites or channels of communication.  
    * Should be moderated ideally by a ranger who also hold a position within the department that holds responsibility for the maintenance and upkeep of that property. If this is not possible then someone who is not a ranger should hold this role. With all the same requirements and responsibilities. That person/s should be known as the moderator/s.  
    * Between a department lead and a moderator they should decide how to deal with issues upon that property.  
    * The moderator should be alerted of any actions taken against anyone and if that person if active on that property. A lead and A moderator should decide between them what action should be taken. If agreement can't be reached them a beacon should be the deciding vote.  
    * Likewise any action taken on the property the moderator should inform the Rangers of what happened.  
  * All actions above should be logged and made available to the beacons on request.  
* In the case of extreme actions:  
  * In cases where stronger punishments are required, 3 rangers at the level of lead or 007 should be in agreement.  
  * The Accused should be informed as soon as this decision is made.  
    * The notifications should include a point of contact for them.  
    * That point of contact should ideally be a way to speak to Beacons, Ranger Leads and 007 for example a specific discord channel that is only available to them, or group email address.  
  * Once the accused has responded to this in anyway that makes it clear they have received the notice.  
    * They have 24 hrs to counter any claims.  
    * This time limit should be extended if there is any weight to their claims.  
  * If the complaint is found to be valid, the accused may face temporary or permanent ban.

* The Beacon Council shall review these lists and ensure that there is no overlap or gap in accountability.

## Article VIII: Events

### **Planning Meetings**

**Should be stopped.** The vast majority of the Burner community don't care about them and/or actively ignore them. It's been noted they are not inclusive and when there was an attempt to make them more inclusive that went well until a small group of people who wouldn't trust fellow burners who knew what they were talking about on the subject were allowed to exclude other burners. They couldn't exhibit the common sense and self-reliance to provide themselves adequate security protections at the cost of the participation and inclusion of other burners.  
Good meetings are self congratulatory circle jerks, Bad meetings are when there is discussion and people don't just fall into line.  
They are a divisive transactional tool of control.

These events are something that if someone new were to turn up to them: (referencing RIST and the Toxic influencer doc.)

* they wouldn't sense an underlying tension. Seeing people explode and random would that seem harmless out of context..
* they wouldn't see a distinct us and them.. where most them them have already been driven off.
* No "Drama"
* No "…incessant attacks on 'certain' members appaling. The constant disregard and shutdown of ideas and helpful projects with heavy bias is also appalling."
* As was suggested by one commenter on RIST "Make it a party."

* To replace the twice-weekly planning meetings, each department and subgroup is responsible for organizing one serious event (training, education, fundraiser, recruitment, public awareness) and one recreational event (party, film-night, games night, etc.) per quarter.
* These events are intended to promote community engagement, participation, creative expression, and inclusivity.

### Quarterly Meetings

* The Beacon Council shall have a standard agenda for quarterly meetings, which should include:  

* Review of department and subgroup progress  
* Discussion of upcoming events and activities  
* Review of complaints process (if any)  
* Other business as necessary

## Article IX: Amendments

Proposal: Amendments to the bylaws may be proposed by any member.  
Approval: Amendments require a two-thirds vote of the Beacon Council and a majority vote of Burners present at the meeting.

### **Transparency**

* Each department and subgroup should have a public notice board in Gerlach, as well as a central notice board for cycling through announcements.
* The Beacon Council shall maintain a record of all complaints, including summaries of incidents, resolutions, and outcomes.

## Article X: Dissolution

Procedure: Upon dissolution, remaining assets shall be distributed to a similar nonprofit organization, as determined by the Beacon Council.

### Suggestions and Recommendations

1. Consider adding a section on Accountability for Department Leads and Subgroup Managers.
2. Regularly review and update the list of subgroups and departments to ensure it remains accurate and comprehensive.
3. Encourage transparency by making sure each subgroup and department has a public notice board in Gerlach, as well as a central notice board for cycling through announcements.
4. Consider implementing a system for tracking and monitoring events, such as a calendar or database, to help plan and coordinate activities.
5. Regularly review and update the Bylaws to ensure they remain relevant and effective.
6. Add a template agenda of aspects that should be covered in quarterly meetings, even if there are no points to discuss.
7. Would be good to have each sound camp state what their main Genre was… and then keep a running list of what is already covered. And maybe times as well.. That way people can plan for a wider variety of Music or Play times.
