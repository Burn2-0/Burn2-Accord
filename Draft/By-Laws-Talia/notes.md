## My Assumptions

*
* That calmer heads prevail and the sheer ridiculousness of puddles and my bans are acknowledged and apologised for. (I will come back to this…)
*
*
*
* I've assumed that Rolling back to a more familiar structure of departments to what I am familiar would be acceptable.  
  * Primarily that "Placement" is just put back under the jurisdiction of DPW.
  * Secondly that the Art Dept is brought back to the forefront.
  * Third and most importantly that the Formation of the Beacons happen. I've specifically picked the numbers I have as for the most part it allows for progression without the need for M2 or 3v to actually do stuff. It also means that there are elected leaders rather than unopposable drunk on power chosen maybe originally for good reasons but now blinded by delusion leaders who are seemingly answerable to no one. Those three are elected, have specific rules inplace to oust any one or more of them.
*
*
*
* Yes, I do talk a lot about things I know I would do were I DPW lead or co-lead.. I would certainly put my name down for it. As long as either these by-laws or some holding an equivalent amount of accountability were in place. That does speak to the level of humble pie I think certain people have pre-ordered. Humble pie unfortunately tastes better and goes down easier when hot…it's been put aside so long now it's probably approaching room temp.  
*
*
*
* That Rangers sit down and work out what exactly happened. Work out some systems to not let it happen again. I've made recommendations in this document over actions that could be taken. But actually enforcing them is up to the rangers.
*
*
*
* TLDR; I Will work with rangers to actually assess what has gone wrong and I ma willing to admit my mistakes publicly if I am matched in that.

 > Does actually bring up the question… What are the leads plans for the future? I don't think the ones in question are so stupid as to not have thought what does occur in the future? cause even if I were to let things go the that point and let you delude yourselves you must know that and some point stuff brush d under the cart claws it's way out again.. usually more pissed off than it was before.. I mean the ranger guidelines specific says not to brush things under the carpet.. That the only time that things should be let go is when things do not need to be. This I will tell you know is needs to be. You may have without discussion chosen to ban me.. but I am in control over where this is something I allow to you brush under or not.

* I would suggestion the Rangers were to also go through all their documentation and see exactly how many corners were cut, guidance and rules flat out ignored and quite often the exact opposite be pushed for.
* I would also suggest that, and I know this is going to seem somewhat pushing things.. I would HIGHLY recommend that rangers were to acknowledge the mistakes at that were made PUBLICLY. I will match this too. Please feel free to add any of my actions/behaviours to this debrief and I will happily acknowledge my mistakes. This is how we move on from this. This is how I let go. This is Analysis, Mediation and Explanation. Given the Mediation Aspect I will also make myself available for discussions. I don't want to speak for her. But I am fairly certain that Puddles would be up for the same as well.

* I Firmly Believe in the Principles and also the Ranger guidelines. I truly believe in them being some of the best ways to deal with people and situations in a way that results in the least ongoing upset when applied correctly.
  * A significant amount of my upset comes from knowing how far from them this situation has strayed. And it seems that what ever document I read through I find examples of how things have gone off course.
* Pretty much since my actual Ban I've consistently said "Have M2 come tell me to my face and I will adhere to the ban to the letter…". That Were the ban anything more than a cruel, unjustified knee jerk reaction to make some complaints disappear… For the sake of certain people saving face… With no consideration what it would do long term to Burn2, it's reputation to the Rangers and their reputation… Keep in mind that the very first content in the ranger manual after a very brief history and what Rangers are about is a section about Social Capital. I will just quote that first paragraph about this…  

> "_Social Capital describes the trust and confidence that participants, staff, law enforcement, and medical personnel have in the Rangers; this is our “street cred.” Social capital is a key source of authority in the city. Without the confidence of participants and staff, we would be unable to function effectively._" pg 10 BR Ranger Manual.

* Please tell me how when the way this situation has been handled has led to the resignation of numerous long standing rangers. Explain how burying heads in playa dust, Ignoring what is plain as day, the issues does anything for regaining the trust of those rangers that left. And If rangers can't even hold enough social capital to hold onto their own how much respect does that get for them outside of their ranks.
* I don't wish anything bad for Burn2 or Rangers holding both in high regard when they actually follow their own rules.  Worst thing is that there is actually still numerous rangers that are trying to help me… And I am literally having to tell them that given the current policies there is really not a lot they can do for me without painting targets on themselves.  
* This is not how rangers should operate.
* _**The single most important thing to do for rangers currently is to reacquire those that have left. Not try to recruit new rangers. That action in itself speaks volumes.**_

   (This I am specifically separating out as if the above points are actioned then this is superfluous if As I am imagining is about likely to happened the delusion is so deep-rooted that it's skewed reality to the point where reality doesn't actually matter… then for the future of B2 probably a good idea to seriously consider the following…)

* I don't know if it was mentioned but I offered to run the anti greifer and the dealing with upset people part of the current ranger ranger training. As the most upset a person could be or the most tricksy of griefers you could possibly face for Octoburn is me if this situation is not resolved… Actually.. In trying to explain this I though of so many ways around it that I've already rendered the offer useless..
