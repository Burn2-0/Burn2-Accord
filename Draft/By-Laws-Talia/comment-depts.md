> I would like to suggest that for the majority of time that I've been back DPW has been empty. Placement however pretty much just plans out the layout and gets people to their spots. I don't know the reason for the division but DPW used to deal with Placement. I would suggest it returns that way.  
> I would also recommend the reimplementation of the Art Department. Numerous people have questioned that lack of it and requested it back. It does help allot having and aesthetic guide.. Someone with a good eye for Form. To my mind, and kind of how things were at BL, the two roles that hold the highest responsibility. As Art Lead and DPW Lead, Being the Form and Function. They between them accounted for the greatest area of land, DPW dealing with Infrastructure and Burner camps and then art dept being responsible for all the art plots, and as they actually started building a long time before anyone else, they would actually be placing down stuff that could steer people in the direction of the aesthetic of the event. Those two roles were like dual quarter backs. There was no way in hell you could do everything involved on your own and I learnt very quickly you had to our source like nobodies business. Besides I loved being able to give people the opportunity to shine.
