# Complaints

-[home](/README.md)-[up](/Draft/Drafts.md)-[index](index.md)-

There should be no time EVER when there is not the ability to question and/or make complaints about leadership. The fact that people are able to be banned for seemingly just for issuing a complaint against certain leads, What exactly does that mean? It's said that all Burners are equal. How many other Burners could:

* ...have complaints issued against them and those are made to vanish.
* ...shut down the complaints system.
* ...fabricate a ban in the name of the sim owner & enforce that ban.
* ...ignore the resignation of long serving rangers due to this.
* ...not attempt to remedy the situation created in order to retain decades worth of experience that disagreed with this policy.
* ...ignore ranger policies with regard to reporting certain events.
* ...repeatedly issue orders and policies that directly contradict ranger policies.
* ...repeatedly issue orders and policies that oppose the Principles and Burner Culture.
* ...show such disregard to SL Policies, common courtesy and human decency.
* ...put others into the position of resigning or doing abuse reportable actions to panda to a delusional ruling.
* ...foster an environment of division, of social transactions, of bullying and marginalisation in "our home".
* ...either be :
  * sociopathic enough to understand the above and not care, relying upon the fear that the current cycles bans has caused to keep them in power.
  * delusional enough to convince themselves they are in the right despite everything.
  * entitled enough that it doesn't matter how bad they hurt people as long as they get to do what they want.
  * right.. pfht... if they were right, why didn't I get a chance to defend myself before I got banned for life and with a gag order  prohibiting my even attempting to appeal the decision...
      > A small challenge for those leads. Please find me a country anywhere in the world currently or in the past where everything that has been done, were Burn2 a country and this considered an application of that countries legal system. Find me an example of a country where this could have happened legally and not enforced by secret police, Militia, Military, Terrorist oh and in peace time. not whilst the country is not in some form of war.
