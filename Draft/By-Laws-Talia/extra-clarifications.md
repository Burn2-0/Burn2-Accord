-[home](/README.md)-[up](/Draft/Drafts.md)-[index](index.md)-

## VOLUNTEER COORD

* FLAMBE LOUNGE? Figure a volunteers Bar area.. name comes from the Volunteers page on the website.  
* RIDE ALONG MEET UP POINT? One thing I definitely did want to introduce was the chance for "Ride - Alongs" To promote greater understanding as to what each dept/group did. I'd really like to see all of them offering Ride Along where anyone can request to shadow any volunteer Obviously on more entry level day to day stuff. But I think this would really help with Volunteer signups and understanding between depts/groups etc.  
* BURN2 NEEDS YOU POSTERS? Chance for a little fun / creative expression in poster designs.

## DMV

* DMV YARD? (only question marked for confirmation…)  
* BP HELL? (No idea who did this… but seems like DMV Terriroty?)  
* ART CAR REZZERS.. OBvs  
* BIKES? Something I've Not Seen so much of… I do actually have the scripts for the bikes….

## DPW

* CONTAINER ZERO? Well… First build down on the player each year was something called "Container Zero"… DPW used to have a Quansit they operated out of.. But they would start from CZERO  
* METRIC - OBVS  
* SIGN POSTS - That Was a collaboration with the Art Dept. Just Nice Arty Sign Posts to Mark the Road Names..  
* POSTAL SERVICE - Well As I was going through the various different infrastructure things I was thinking that a postal service might be a fun little project. Could be good for a lot of things… competitions, suggestions, etc etc…

## Comms  

* MEDIA MECCA? Well it's where Comms/Press operate from…  
* WHAT IS HAPPENING BOARDS? Just a Now and Next system to people know what is going on. This covers anyone who is not already group.. and present a good opportunity for group signup..  
* NEWSPAPER DISPENSORS? Hook up for to the blog section on the website or something on a hud.

## Greeters

* MAIN GATE - Obvs  
* REALITY CHECK POINTS - Basically aid stations.  
* PHONE BOOTHS - Mini aid stations Or maybe have an AI Operator to answer questions.

## PERF

* CENTRE CAMP - Would be nice to see more going on there…  
* DEEP PLAYA STAGE - Would be great to have a location where people could go "BIG" with particle shows..  
* CAMP RADIOSWould be cool to have access to all the active streams…

## ART DEPT

* HEARTERY - Seem approprait…  
* WELL THAT WAS UNEXPECTED? aka Owls "WtWU" ;) - Lotsa really random little features to surprise and entertain….  
* PORTA POTTIES - OWls are basically an expansion on this Idea… Have a basic Porta Potty design That people are given and it's up to them to decorate in what ever way they see fit.

## FASHION

* FASHIONISTA STAGE - OBVS  
* CHANGING ROOM? - setup some proper changing rooms, Have some Fashionista there to aid and advise of Playa Glow Ups… Could even be a fed for a secondary Fashionista event… could even do before and after shots with the freshly "Glowed" Burner bursting through their Before photo…  
* AFFIRMATION MIRRORS? Well as we now have mirrors.. Could have some random free standing mirrors spread about the place that when someone stood in front of them not only would then seem themselves but their mirror self would give words of wisdom or affirmation?

## RANGERS

* RANGER HQ - Same old. (although if you want I could make 101 suggestions)  
* RANGER OUTPOSTS - Same old. (although rolling this in with a load of the other suggestions might be good..)  
* PANIC BUTTONS - If they ain't broke…

## LAMP LIGHTERS

* LAMP LIGHTER VILLAGE - (sure I could make some suggestions but yeah only thing that immediately springs to mind as an issue is that you kinda feel like you shouldn't be there…)  
* DRUM CIRCLE? - Just a Drum Circle out on DEEP Playa to play with where there wouldn't be too many people to disturb.  
* SPIRES - Pretty sure could be optimized but yeah nothing of note.

## BWOB

* AUDITORIUM? Lectures, Speeches, other speaking events? Poetry readings? Story telling?  
* WORLD MAP? Some where in my inv I have a US and A World map showing all of the regional Burns… OOoo My Experience Orb Might work well for this…  
* REGIONAL INFO SIGNS - Maybe if camps are associated with a regional Burn they could have the chance to request a sign giving into about the near by camps regional burns with a "Check in at camp X for first hand reports…"

## B2.TV

* B2.TV TRANSMISSION RV..? Might Be nice to have a little setup around it.. Interview area etc.. Puddles has a Not quite as long document as this one in relation to my thoughts;)  
* CINEMA? DRIVE_IN? - Well it's a regular on the current events schedule.. Beyond the usual Films if B2.TV we involved could certainly pull in a whole load of Machinima peeps.  
* TVPILES? Random Piles of TV's Showing a variety of older footage..
